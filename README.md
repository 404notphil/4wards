# 4wards
This is an app concept which I pursued for awhile, creating a design ([see full design in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/QordmNl8xEGsK45lPtWoIP/4wards?node-id=0%3A1&t=K18VX91yyyC2fqOZ-1)) and evaluating the idea for technical feasibility and value. The project has been shelved in favor of other ideas.

## Concept
4wards is a time-effort tracking app geared toward self-guided learners (think software development learners, music enthusiasts, athletes, etc). 

The problem statement: _Some subjects don't lend themselves well to goal-making; you can't make a new-years resolution of "I will gain 20 pounds of muscle mass" if you don't yet know the possibilities of your body. You CAN, however, resolve to put a certain amount of time and effort towards your training._

In this app, time and effort are merged into one value which a user can pour into a subject. Goals are optional, and if they are created, they must be expressed as and amount time-effort within a certain amount of time, not as specific outcomes. The tracking is realized with clock-in/clock-out functionality, and upon clocking-out (finishing a "Session"), a user reports which topics were worked on, and reports a few other values which will be crunched into a final time-effort value and distributed to the appropriate subjects. That value will influence the overall "immersion" level of that topic. 

If the user wishes to do so, they can create schedules for their work within the following hierarchy:
- "Paths" - Groups of topics that related to each other, such as "Piano practice"
- "Pushes" - A "sprint"-like time period that may last two weeks or so
- "Days" - Refers to any planned day which actually contains work. 
- "Sessions" - This one is obligatory. Any work you do will be in the form of a session. But you can have sessions outside of a structured schedule.
